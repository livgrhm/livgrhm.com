  that is also acutely aware of people and business needs. Working with Olivia at Next Jump makes me one of
  these lucky few. Olivia and I started at Next Jump around the same time in 2011 and I had a pleasure of
  seeing Olivia grow personally and professionally during our five years together. When working alongside
  Olivia on various projects, I was particularly impressed at her ability to take full ownership and leadership
  of the projects and direct them to the path of success. Olivia's work ethic and time management skills are exceptional,
  I have seen her juggle multiple projects simultaneously with ease. Any company would be lucky to have Olivia on their team."
