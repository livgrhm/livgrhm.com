*Recently I applied and was selected to speak at ThinkNation &amp; Accenture's International Women's Day event on 1st March 2017; the topic of discussion was "How far can you go?"*

Last Wednesday (1st March 2017) I joined 12 other young women and spoke at <a href="//thinknation.co/node/586" target="_blank">ThinkNation's International Women's Day event</a> sponsored by Accenture and hosted at the Institute of Engineering and Technology in London. When the full video is available I will post a link, but check out the following wrap-up video of the day (ft. me right at the end).

<a href="//thinknation.co/about" target="_blank">ThinkNation's</a> focus is to give young people a platform to talk about their experiences related to technology and aims to shed light on big questions (like how AI and social media are affecting us). The question we were answering was from Accenture's BIG 2017 International Women's Day question <mark>"How far can you go?"</mark>.

This was different from other events; it included a workshop that spanned the entire day, where a group of mentors from Accenture and elsewhere helped the speakers to come up with a well structured and meaningful 5 minute talk. My prior experience has been putting together talks by myself, trying to get as much honest feedback as possible by practicing with people around me and then rocking up to the event with my fingers crossed. This workshop approach not only produced a decent and refined talk but shared knowledge on the process too.

I was paired with another young woman, Emma, who had made a jump from an Art History background into an MSc in Technology Entrepreneurship and starting her own IoT company. I made a recent jump from a permanent job into the unknown world of freelancing, and our applications had matched based on us working on our confidence and changing career direction.

We worked with mentors Annie and Parveen to construct a 5 minute talk and after several hours of brainstorming, post-it notes, sketches, iteration and (a lot of) story sharing, we settled on a final theme of "investing in risk". Emma and I had both taken a risk and headed towards the unknown despite our fears and lack of confidence, and the point we wanted to emphasize is that it's not about just jumping in and taking risks blindly. <mark>Time and <b>investment</b> in your personal development is needed to prepare you to take those risks.</mark>

We worked together to knit our different stories together into a final talk, practiced our delivery and at the end of the day presented it to the panel and the audience. The stress of it all was relieved by seeing the 4 other inspiring talks by young women that were so different from our own.

<h2>My Stories</h2>

I wanted to share briefly the 3 key stories (and 3 key points) from my side of the talk. Unsurprisingly I have a lot to say on these topics so I'm sure you'll hear more from me here... I should be able to share the full talk soon and you'll be able to see what the other young women spoke about too.

<blockquote>
<b>Key Points:</b><br>
1. To improve, you have to do what scares you.<br>
2. Take time to define what you're passionate about.<br>
3. Turn your regret into your drive.

1. <mark><b>To improve, you have to do what scares you.</b></mark>
- A few years ago I literally could not speak publicly; on joining Next Jump straight out of University I attended a Toastmasters session in which I attempted a one minute table-topic and proceeded to go bright red, apologise and sit down again. I *hated* those Toastmasters sessions (to be honest I still seriously disliked them 4 years later) because they scared me; I was embarrassed about not being good at it and I was scared that my colleagues were judging me for it. However I forced myself to go, week after week. I put myself forward to speak internally and at every opportunity I could find, to speak at recruiting events in front of University students and increasing crowds. Gradually it got easier, I hated it less; I could feel myself becoming less nervous, getting better and was able to push myself to improve on my speaking skills. My instinct is still very much to avoid doing things I'm worried I'm not good at, but it's important to recognise that and push yourself to do those things, because the rewards are great.

- A key piece of feedback I received whilst I was at Next Jump was that I sounded bored when I spoke and lacked passion. This frustrated me as it wasn't how I felt inside, but when I was honest with myself I realised I was worrying too much about what other people thought of me &amp; my ideas, which was stifling my passion; I just came across as apathetic and not bothered about anything. When you're at school and university you have a distinct focus on getting to the next stage academically and it's easy not to stop and think about what you actually want to do, what impact you want to have on the world. So I took some time to really think about what I care about, and I settled on 3 key areas; Education, Technology and Women in Technology. Having that clarity in my mind instantly made a difference and I worked on actively speaking to people about those things. I found I connected better with people as I was projecting my honest feelings and talking about things I care about. It opened doors for me, got me involved in exciting projects (like Next Jump's Adopt a School initiative) and gave me more direction in my life.
3. <mark><b>Turn your regret into your drive.</b></mark>
- About a year ago, I decided that I wanted to make a career change and work at Facebook. I did a telephone-coding interview and afterwards knew it wasn't my best. They called me back and confirmed what I thought; it didn't go that well, BUT they really liked me, so could I do the test again? I declined the offer. I don't regret where I am now and the path I have taken, but I do regret chickening out of that opportunity because I didn't take the chance to improve myself and I can never know what might have come out of it. I declined out of fear, not because I was doing the right thing (which is what I told myself). When I decided to start freelancing I was scared; scared I'm not a good enough developer, scared I wouldn't get work, scared I wasn't strong enough to face the obstacles. But I reminded myself of the Facebook regret - I don't want to live my life based on fear of not being good enough, I want to live it based on opportunity and deliberate choices. I'm moving to Berlin in May and I'm secretly terrified, but it's an opportunity that I am making the active decision to take (with no regrets).
